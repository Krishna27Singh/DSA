A local class cannot access the local variables of the enclosing function
however it can access the static variables of the enclosing function and exteral variables/global variables and functions
A global class can access the global/static varibales! 

NESTED class
class A{
    class B{

    }
}
# class B cannot access members of class access
# scope of B is limited to A 
# if you want to create objects of class B we need to proceed the name of class A 
# A::B obj we can make object of B like this

EMPTY CLASS 
NO DATA MEMBERS NO MEMBER function
class class_Name{

};

ANONYMOUS CLASS 
# no name for the class
class {'

} obj1, obj2;
# we have to declare the objects just after the class declaration

COMPOSITION AND CONTAINERSHIP AND COMPLEX objects
class B{

};
class C{

};
class A{
    B objB;
    C objC;
};
# class A contains objects of class B and CLASS CLASS C 
# through object of class A we can call members and member function of class B and class C 
# composition is a relationship wherer one clas sown another class completely
# if the parent object is destroyed the child object is also destroyed

FRIEND FUNCTION 
# friend function can acces private, public or protected members of that class
# in some cases it cannot
# friend function does not have any object by default

class Rectangle{
float l, b;
public: 
    void Input();
    friend void area(Rectangle &);
};

void Rectangle :: Input(){
    cin>>l>>b;
}

void area(Rectangle &r){
    float area = r.l * r.b;
    cout<<area<<endl;
    return;
}

int main(){
    Rectangle r1; 
    r1.Input();
    area(r);
    return 0;
}
# not all the work which is done by member function should be done by the friend function becaause it violates the data hiding principal of cpp.
# friend function do not has a "this" pointer.
# if you want to work with the data members of two classes, there comes the need of friend function!
# friend function can be declared in either private or public.

class B {}; -> forward declaration so that it does not give error in class A 
class A{
int a;
friend void sum( A&, B& );
};

class B{
int b; 
public:
    friend void sum( A&, B&);
};

void sum( A& Aobj, B& Bobj){
    cout<< Aobj.a + Bobj.b <<endl;
}

int main(){
    A obj1;
    B obj2;
    obj1.Input();
    obj2.Input();
    sum(obj1, obj2);
    return 0;
}

ft& addFeetAndInches(ft& f, in& i){
    ft temp;
    temp.feet = f.feet + (i.inches)/12.0 ;
    return temp;
}

int main(){
    ft f1, f2;
    in i1;
    f1.input();
    f2 = addFeetAndInches(f1, i1);
}
