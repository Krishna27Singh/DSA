A local class cannot access the local variables of the enclosing function
however it can access the static variables of the enclosing function and exteral variables/global variables and functions
A global class can access the global/static varibales! 

NESTED class
class A{
    class B{

    }
}
# class B cannot access members of class access
# scope of B is limited to A 
# if you want to create objects of class B we need to proceed the name of class A 
# A::B obj we can make object of B like this

EMPTY CLASS 
NO DATA MEMBERS NO MEMBER function
class class_Name{

};

ANONYMOUS CLASS 
# no name for the class
class {'

} obj1, obj2;
# we have to declare the objects just after the class declaration

COMPOSITION AND CONTAINERSHIP AND COMPLEX objects
class B{

};
class C{

};
class A{
    B objB;
    C objC;
};
# class A contains objects of class B and CLASS CLASS C 
# through object of class A we can call members and member function of class B and class C 
# composition is a relationship wherer one clas sown another class completely
# if the parent object is destroyed the child object is also destroyed

FRIEND FUNCTION 
# friend function can acces private, public or protected members of that class
# in some cases it cannot
# friend function does not have any object by default

class Rectangle{
float l, b;
public: 
    void Input();
    friend void area(Rectangle &);
};

void Rectangle :: Input(){
    cin>>l>>b;
}

void area(Rectangle &r){
    float area = r.l * r.b;
    cout<<area<<endl;
    return;
}
